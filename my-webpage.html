                    <h3>Castle of Good Hope</h3>
                    <p>
                        1.Built between 1666 and 1679, the Castle of Good Hope was originally used by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as a maritime replenishment station
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.The building used to be on the coastline of Table Bay before the land was reclaimed and it moved inland
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.The slate used as paving came from quarries on Robben Island
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                    <img srcset="" alt="Castle of Good Hope" >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h3> City Hall</h3>
                    <p>
                        <img srcset="" alt="City hall" >
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <p> 1.Nelson Mandela gave a speech from the balcony of City Hall immediately upon his release from prison. This was his first public address in 27 years, during which he spoke about his commitment to democracy, peace and reconciliation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        2.City Hall, as its name suggests, was built to function as the centre of city administration and as such housed the offices of the City of Cape Town
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.At the heart of its tower is a turret clock, half the scale of Big Ben, that strikes the hours and chimes the Westminster Chimes (a specific, and well known, melody chimed every 15 minutes that is also known as the Cambridge Quarters and originates from the church of St Mary the Great in Cambridge).
                    </p>
                    <h3>District Six Museum</h3>
                     <p>
                        <img srcset="" alt="Distcrict six" >
                     </p>
                    <p> 
                        1.The District Six Museum was not always a powerfully moving home for the stories of the areas former residents. Prior to its current purpose, it was a wine shop until the Methodists took it over in 1883 and founded the Buitenkamp Methodist Mission Church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.Currently, the museum serves as a remembrance of the once lively multi-racial area that was forcefully removed during apartheid in the 1960s and 1970
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.Visitors learn about this once colourful hub for musicians, artists, and ‘good’ and ‘bad’ gangsters, that faced a 20-year long period of demolition and forced removals during the apartheid era.
